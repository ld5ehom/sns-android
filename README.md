    - Organizing Login Flow with Hilt and Navigation Compose
      - Since the login process is part of a single context, the navigation component was used to group it into one flow. Hilt and Navigation Compose were integrated to manage dependencies and navigation within the login flow.
    - Added Navigation and Hilt Integration (gradle : presentation)
      - Integrated navigation-compose and hilt-navigation-compose dependencies in the presentation module to manage navigation and dependency injection within the composable screens.
    - Login Navigation Host (LoginNavHost)
      - Created a host that manages three composables (LoginScreen, SignUpScreen, WelcomeScreen) within a single context, allowing seamless navigation between them.
    - Login Route (LoginRoute)
      - Instead of hardcoding route names directly in the composables, a LoginRoute sealed class was created to store and reference route names in a centralized and organized way, making them easier to manage and reducing errors. 
    - LoginActivity with Navigation and Theming
      - LoginActivity sets up the login UI using Jetpack Compose, applies the SNSTheme, and manages navigation between login-related screens (WelcomeScreen, LoginScreen, and SignUpScreen) via LoginNavHost for a cohesive login flow.
    - LoginViewModel with Hilt and Coroutines
      - The LoginViewModel handles the login logic using Hilt for dependency injection. It integrates the LoginUseCase to manage the login process, and uses viewModelScope to launch coroutines, ensuring that login operations are performed asynchronously when the user clicks the login button.
  - **LoginViewModel Refactoring and Error Fixes with Dagger and Orbit MVI** - [commit 2258ba2](https://github.com/ld5ehom/sns-android/commit/2258ba23aba26418981cff0cf2e4b274a9e9ece3)
    - Error : Dagger Missing binding 
      - The Login ViewModel requested the LoginUseCase, but the LoginUseCase implementation was not bound to the Hilt graph, causing an error.
      - To resolve this, the LoginUseCaseImpl was bound in the data module, considering the login functionality.
    - Error : LoginActivity Implement interface dagger.hilt 
      - The error occurred in presentation/login/LoginActivity requiring the implementation of a Dagger Hilt interface.
      - Added @AndroidEntryPoint to LoginActivity.
    - data/usecase/LoginUseCaseImpl 
      - LoginUseCaseImpl uses Dagger's @Inject for dependency injection, and the invoke function returns a token within a result.
    - Refactoring LoginViewModel with Orbit MVI and State Management
      - The LoginViewModel has been refactored to enhance state management and handle side effects more effectively using the Orbit MVI (Model-View-Intent) pattern. This update improves the structure of the login feature by managing user input, login logic, and error handling in a clearer and more maintainable way.
      - Integrated Orbit MVI Pattern: LoginViewModel now implements ContainerHost to manage login state (LoginState) and side effects (LoginSideEffect), providing clear state management.
      - Added LoginState: LoginState now holds the login credentials (ID, password), enabling cleaner and more predictable state updates.
      - Introduced Side Effect Handling: LoginSideEffect manages UI-related actions like showing toast messages, keeping business logic separate from the UI.
      - Improved Error Handling: A CoroutineExceptionHandler now handles login errors, showing error messages via side effects.
      - Input Handling Updates: Added onIdChange and onPasswordChange to update state when user input changes.
  - **Login Feature Updates: Password Masking, Orbit MVI Integration and Retrofit Setup** - [13f4a3e](https://github.com/ld5ehom/sns-android/commit/13f4a3e1e5d607da72b734bdc1905d40562784ac)
    - CustomTextField Update for Password Masking
      - Password Masking Added: visualTransformation was added to hide text input for password fields using PasswordVisualTransformation.
    - Enhancements in LoginScreen with Orbit MVI Integration
      - Orbit MVI for State and Side-Effect Management:
        - Integrated Orbit MVI for managing state and side effects. The collectAsState function is utilized to capture login credentials (id, password), and collectSideEffect manages side effects such as toast messages through LoginSideEffect.Toast.
      - Improved Input Handling and Event Triggering:
        - Added PasswordVisualTransformation to the password field for secure input handling. The login button now triggers onLoginClick in the LoginViewModel, linking UI actions to the ViewModel’s business logic.
    - RetrofitModule: Integrated OkHttpClient and JSON Converter for API Requests
      - OkHttpClient: Provides an OkHttpClient instance bound to the Dagger dependency graph to handle network requests. 
      - Retrofit Configuration: Configures Retrofit with kotlinx.serialization for JSON conversion, ignoring unknown keys during deserialization for flexibility. The API's base URL is set to the ld5ehom_HOST, and the OkHttpClient is attached for managing HTTP requests.
  - **Standardized API Interaction with Retrofit and CommonResponse** - [commit 8d015e8](https://github.com/ld5ehom/sns-android/commit/8d015e824489c5c7d59414148dda680e31735871)
    - data/retrofit/UserService

    - data/model/LoginParam
      - The LoginParam class is a data model used to store the login credentials (loginId and password) for API requests. It includes a method toRequestBody() that converts the LoginParam object into a JSON-formatted RequestBody, which is required for making login API requests.
    - LoginUseCaseImpl Implementation with Dagger for API Integration
      - LoginUseCaseImpl leverages Dagger's @Inject for dependency injection, automatically providing UserService to handle login API calls. The invoke function converts user credentials into a request body, calls the login API, and safely handles the response using Kotlin’s runCatching.

      - This ensures immediate and synchronous state updates, improving user experience and input handling in the application.
    - Navigation to MainActivity After Successful Login
      - Added navigation logic to redirect users to MainActivity after a successful login. 
      - The Intent flags FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TASK and FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK are used to start MainActivity in a new task and clear the back stack, ensuring that the login screen is removed from the history.
    - GetTokenUseCaseImpl: Retrieving User Token from DataStore
      - GetTokenUseCaseImpl retrieves the user's authentication token from UserDataStore by implementing the GetTokenUseCase interface.
    - SetTokenUseCaseImpl: Handling Token Storage via UserDataStore
      - SetTokenUseCaseImpl handles saving the user's authentication token into UserDataStore. 
      - The invoke function takes the token and stores it by calling setToken() in the DataStore.
    - data/UserDataStore: Managing User Token in DataStore

    - SplashActivity: Token Check and Navigation Based on Login Status
      - The SplashActivity checks the user's login status by retrieving the token via GetTokenUseCase. 
      - If a token exists, it navigates to the MainActivity. If not, it directs the user to the LoginActivity. 
      - The activity uses Intent flags (FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TASK and FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK) to clear the task stack and prevent returning to the splash screen.
    - SplashActivity: Set as Main Entry Point in Android Manifest
      - Added SplashActivity to the AndroidManifest.xml file as the main entry point of the application. 
      - The intent filter with MAIN action and LAUNCHER category ensures that this activity is launched when the app is opened.
    - Dagger/MissingBinding Error : Binding Token UseCase Implementations to Interfaces with Dagger
      - Added bindings for the token-related use cases (GetTokenUseCaseImpl, SetTokenUseCaseImpl, and ClearTokenUseCaseImpl) to their corresponding interfaces in the Dagger dependency graph using @Binds. 
      - This ensures that the correct implementations are injected wherever the use case interfaces are required.
    - Dagger/MissingBinding Error -> AppModule: Binding Application Context for Dependency Injection

      - The start destination is set to the "Home" screen, with a top bar showing the app title and a bottom navigation bar for switching between screens.
    - MainBottomBar: Handling Navigation and Icon Highlighting in the Bottom Bar
      - The MainBottomBar component provides navigation functionality within the app using the NavController. 
      - It determines the current route and navigates between the "Home", "Profile", and "Post" screens, with special handling for starting WritingActivity when the "Post" route is selected. 
      - The bottom bar highlights the currently selected icon using MaterialTheme.
      - For the "Post" route, a separate activity (PostActivity) is launched, while navigation for the other routes is handled within the same navigation graph using the NavController.
    - MainRoute Enum Update: Renaming Routes and Descriptions
      - The MainRoute enum was updated to reflect changes in route names and descriptions.
      - The corresponding routes and content descriptions were updated to "HomeScreen" (Post List), "PostScreen" (Create Post), and "ProfileScreen" (My Profile), aligning with the new functionality and navigation structure.
  - **Profile Screen UI and ViewModel Updates** - [48e052b](https://github.com/ld5ehom/sns-android/commit/48e052b73a4a86f4217b901ee3ea417ec3a2730b)
    - Profile Screen UI
      - Profile Screen UI and Logic: Implements a screen for managing user profile settings such as username, profile image, and logout functionality. It handles navigation to the login screen and displays a toast message for certain actions.
      - Composable Structure: The ProfileScreen composable displays user profile settings and provides buttons for changing the profile image, editing the username, and logging out. The UI includes state management using the ProfileViewModel.
    - Profile Image Component
      - CustomProfileImage Component: Displays a profile image inside a circular frame. If no profile image URL is provided, a default person icon is displayed.
      - Customization: The component allows for customization of the image and border via the modifier and borderWidth parameters.
    - Profile Screen ViewModel and State Management
      - ProfileViewModel: Manages the state of the profile screen, including loading the user’s profile information (username and profile image) and handling the logout process.
      - State and Side Effect Management: Utilizes Orbit MVI to manage the state and side effects. It updates the screen state with user data and handles side effects like showing toast messages and navigating to the login screen on logout.
    - Error Handling in ClearToken Use Case
      - ClearTokenUseCase: The Result<Unit> return type was added to the ClearTokenUseCase interface to standardize the error-handling mechanism for clearing the user's token.
      - ClearTokenUseCaseImpl: In the ClearTokenUseCaseImpl implementation, kotlin.runCatching{} was introduced to wrap the token-clearing logic. This guarantees that any exceptions raised during the userDataStore.clear() operation are caught and returned as part of a Result<Unit>.
    - UserDTO Data Model and Domain Conversion
      - UserDTO: A serializable data transfer object (DTO) designed for use with APIs. It represents user-related data fields including id, loginId, userName, extraUserInfo, and profileFilePath.
  - **Retrofit Integration with Custom Interceptor for Token Management and Dynamic Headers** - [fc7a012](https://github.com/ld5ehom/sns-android/commit/fc7a0121846aa6f26d31754840394ba0fb924c14)
    - GetMyUserUseCaseImpl: Fetching and Mapping User Data
      - GetMyUserUseCaseImpl: Fetches user data by calling the myPage() API from the UserService. The result is wrapped in a Result<User> to handle potential errors.
      - Domain Conversion: Converts the response from the DTO format to a domain-specific User model using the toDomainModel() function for further use within the application.
    - UserDTO Update: Domain Model Conversion Function
      - Domain Model Conversion Added: The toDomainModel function was added to the UserDTO class, allowing it to be easily converted into a domain-specific User model.
    - Adding Binding for GetMyUserUseCase in User Module
      - Binding GetMyUserUseCase Implementation: The bindGetMyUserUseCase function was added to the User module using Dagger's @Binds annotation.
    - Retrofit and Custom Interceptor Implementation for Token Management and HTTP 401 Error Handling
      - CustomInterceptor for Dynamic Headers: The CustomInterceptor class was implemented to dynamically inject headers into all API requests. It retrieves the authentication token from UserDataStore and adds it as a "Token" header if available.
      - OkHttpClient with CustomInterceptor: The OkHttpClient is configured to use CustomInterceptor for injecting headers dynamically. This ensures that headers like the token and content type are automatically included in every request without needing to specify them individually in UserService.
      - Retrofit Configuration: A Retrofit instance is provided with the OkHttpClient (configured with the interceptor) and a JSON converter that ignores unknown keys.
      - UserService API Integration: With the interceptor handling the dynamic headers, the UserService interface now relies on Retrofit.create() for API calls, without needing manual @Headers declarations in the service methods.
  - **OkHttpClient Interceptor Integration** - [ebed6fa](https://github.com/ld5ehom/sns-android/commit/ebed6fad4d2d3f384eb9f8ad167d5cfebfd594bd)

  - **Profile User Name Change Feature Update** - [1953696](https://github.com/ld5ehom/sns-android/commit/19536963c4a2385016e4af3d3373cb47e8e5fa80)
    - presentation/profile/UsernameDialog
      - The UsernameDialog composable provides a dialog interface for users to update their profile name. It displays an input field pre-filled with the user's current username, and allows the user to modify it. This functionality is designed for efficient and interactive profile name management, with callbacks for handling changes and dismissing the dialog.
    - ProfileScreen Update  
      - The ProfileScreen was updated to allow users to change their username by displaying a UsernameDialog. The dialog collects the new username and triggers an API call to update the user's profile.
      - The dialog is shown when usernameDialogVisible is true, and the new username is passed to the onUsernameChange function in ProfileViewModel, which handles the update logic.
    - ProfileViewModel update: 
      - Username Change Handling: A new method onUsernameChange is added to the Profile ViewModel, which calls the setMyUserUseCase to update the user's profile name with the provided username.
      - State Management: The use case is executed within an intent block, and if successful, the updated profile is reloaded by calling load(), ensuring the UI reflects the changes immediately.
    - UserService Update 
      - A new patchMyPage method was added to the UserService interface. This method sends a PATCH request to update the user's profile by accepting a RequestBody as input and returning a CommonResponse<Long>.
    - SetMyUserUseCaseImpl: Handling User Profile Updates
      - User Profile Update: The SetMyUserUseCaseImpl implementation handles updating the user's profile by sending the updated username and profile image URL to the server via UserService.
      - Fetch and Merge Current Data: If the new username or profile image is not provided, it fetches the current user data using GetMyUserUseCase to ensure no data is lost during the update.
      - API Integration: It uses UserService.patchMyPage to send the update request to the server after constructing the request body with UpdateMyInfoParam.
    - UpdateMyInfoParam: Data Class for User Profile Updates
      - User Profile Update: UpdateMyInfoParam is a serializable data class used to encapsulate the parameters needed for updating user information (username, profile image path, and extra user details) via API.
      - JSON Serialization: It includes a toRequestBody method that converts the data into a JSON-formatted RequestBody, which is essential for making API requests.
      - API Communication: The data is serialized to ensure it's in the correct format for being transmitted to the backend through the patchMyPage API.
    - UserModule : Binding SetMyUserUseCase Implementation in UserModule
      - Dependency Injection with Dagger: This line of code in the UserModule binds the SetMyUserUseCaseImpl implementation to the SetMyUserUseCase interface using Dagger's @Binds annotation.
  - **Profile User Image Change Feature Update**
    - ProfileScreen Update : Image Change Feature Added
      - Integrated an image picker using rememberLauncherForActivityResult to allow users to select an image from their device. When the user clicks to change the profile image, the media picker is launched, limited to image files only. The selected image is then handled in the ViewModel's onImageChange function to update the profile picture.
    - ProfileViewModel Update : Profile Image Update Handling
      - The onImageChange function updates the user's profile image by calling setProfileImageUseCase and reloading the user's profile to reflect the changes.
    - SetProfileImageUseCase: Interface Definition and Domain Considerations
      - SetProfileImageUseCase defines a contract for updating the user's profile image using a content URI.
      - Since the Android Uri class is part of the Android framework and cannot be used in the domain layer, the content URI is passed as a String to maintain platform independence.
    - SetProfileImageUseCaseImpl: Image Upload Logic 
      - The image upload flow involves fetching user information, retrieving image details from the URI, uploading the image to the server, and updating the profile with the new image URL.
    - Image Data Model : Serialization Dependency
      - In Android's Clean Architecture, data resides at the core of the application, and the architecture's dependency rule allows the outer layers (such as data or presentation) to depend on the inner core (domain). Hence, the Image class is placed in the domain layer, and rather than creating separate DTOs or UI models for the data and presentation layers, the same model is reused across the entire app to simplify code structure.
      - Kotlinx.serialization.json was added as a dependency to handle the serialization and deserialization of the Image data model into and from JSON. This enables seamless conversion of the Image data class for network communication and data persistence.
    - UploadImageUseCaseImpl: Uploading Images via FileService 
      - The UploadImageUseCaseImpl class is responsible for uploading images to the server using FileService. It converts the image into multipart form data, including the file name and image file itself, and returns the file path of the uploaded image.
    - FileService : File Upload API
      - This API defines an interface for uploading files using multipart form data, including the file name and the file itself.
    - data/di/RetofitModule Update : FileService Binding
      - This update adds functionality for binding the FileService interface to Retrofit, enabling API calls for file uploads.
    - UriRequestBody : Handling Content Upload from URI
      - UriRequestBody is a custom RequestBody class used for uploading files from a content URI. It retrieves the input stream from the URI and writes it to a BufferedSink, handling multipart file uploads.
    - GetInputStreamUseCaseImpl: Fetching InputStream from Content URI
      - The GetInputStreamUseCaseImpl class implements the logic to retrieve an InputStream from a content URI using the Android content resolver. It returns the result wrapped in a Result object.
    - FileModule: Binding Use Cases to Interfaces
      - This module binds the implementations of GetInputStreamUseCase, GetImageUseCase, and UploadImageUseCase to their respective interfaces. These bindings are installed in a SingletonComponent.
    - GetImageUseCaseImpl: Retrieving Image Metadata from URI
      - The GetImageUseCaseImpl class is responsible for retrieving metadata, such as the image name, size, and MIME type, from a content URI using the content resolver. It returns an Image object with the gathered information.
